
## ðŸš€ **Recent Optimizations (v0.2.0)**

This version includes significant optimizations and improvements:

- **Fixed Random Number Generator**: Corrected xorshift64* algorithm implementation for better randomness quality
- **Enhanced Security**: Improved seed generation with multiple entropy sources and secure memory clearing
- **Performance Optimizations**: Specialized algorithms for common alphabet sizes and reduced memory allocations
- **Unified Validation**: Consolidated parameter validation logic for better maintainability
- **Extended Testing**: Comprehensive test suite including edge cases, performance, and security tests
- **Better Error Handling**: Detailed error messages with helpful guidance
- **Fail-fast Security**: Removed deterministic fallback to prevent predictable ID generation
